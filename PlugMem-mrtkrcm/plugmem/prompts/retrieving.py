            "- Only generate tags that are HIGHLY LIKELY to retrieve evidence needed to solve/complete the Goal.\n"

            "  - The target entity/entities the Goal is asking about (people, organizations, places, works, events).\n"
            "  - Bridge entities implied by the observation that are likely required for multi-hop retrieval.\n"
            "  - Explicit constraints: dates, years, roles, titles, unique descriptors, numbers.\n"
            "- Avoid low-signal or generic tags that are unlikely to retrieve helpful evidence (e.g., \"known for\", \"famous\", \"character\" unless the Goal specifically depends on them).\n"
            "\n"
            "2) Concrete, Grounded Tags:\n"
            "- The MAJORITY of tags MUST be short text spans copied VERBATIM from the Goal or the Current Observation (exact substrings).\n"
            "- You MAY add a SMALL number of non-literal tags only if they are short, strongly implied, and clearly necessary for retrieval (e.g., a canonical name expansion or a standard alias).\n"
            "- If a tag is a verb, you MUST use its base (lemma) form (e.g., \"direct\", not \"directed\" or \"directing\").\n"
            "\n"
            "3) Prioritization & Quantity:\n"
            "- Output 5-12 tags total (not \"as many as possible\").\n"
            "- Sort tags by expected retrieval usefulness (most useful first).\n"
            "- Ensure tags are content-bearing and relatively short.\n"
            "\n"
            "4) CRITICAL - Forbidden tags:\n"
            "- Do NOT generate the tag \"user\".\n"
            "- Do NOT use meta-labels or type names such as \"Name\", \"Person\", \"Year\", \"Date\", \"City\", \"Country\", \"Location\", \"Genre\", \"FilmTitle\", etc.\n"

You are given two memory items about a related topic. One came earlier (Information 1) and the other came later (Information 2).

Your tasks:
(1) Merge them into ONE improved, clear, concise statement. Do not invent new facts.
(2) Decide whether to deactivate (soft delete) the original two nodes after merging.

Inputs:
Information 1 (Earlier Information): {memory_earlier}
Information 2 (Later Information): {memory_later}

Deactivation decision rules (choose exactly ONE case):

Case A: "UPDATE_SAME_FACT"
- Condition: Information 1 and 2 are essentially describing the same fact/event, and Information 2 mainly updates/corrects/refines details of Information 1.
- Action: deactivate BOTH originals (earlier and later) because the merged node fully supersedes them.

Case B: "SAME_TOPIC_MERGE_WELL"
- Condition: Information 1 and 2 are strongly related under the same topic, and the merged statement reads naturally as a unified summary (not an awkward splice).
- Action: deactivate BOTH originals (earlier and later).

Case C: "WEAK_RELATED_STITCH_RISK"
- Condition: Information 1 and 2 are only weakly related; merging feels like stitching two segments; and deactivating either original would likely harm future retrieval because the merged embedding may become a mixed "四不像".
- Action: deactivate NEITHER original.

Hard constraints:
- Output MUST be valid JSON (no Markdown, no extra text).
- relationship MUST be one of the three labels above.
- If relationship is Case A or B => deactivate_earlier=true AND deactivate_later=true.
- If relationship is Case C => deactivate_earlier=false AND deactivate_later=false.
- If the two memories conflict, prefer Information 2 as the more up-to-date.
- Output the simple reasoning of why you made the decision.

Output MUST be valid JSON with exactly these keys:
- merged_statement (string)
- relationship ("UPDATE_SAME_FACT" | "SAME_TOPIC_MERGE_WELL" | "WEAK_RELATED_STITCH_RISK")
- deactivate_earlier (boolean)
- deactivate_later (boolean)
- simple_reasoning (string)

Return ONLY the JSON object.
